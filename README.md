## USAGE ##

First you will need to have NodeJS and Yarn installed on your local machine. You can find these packages here: 
https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

To run the app, first clone the repo. You will need two terminal windows open. First, while in the root directory, run yarn install, then run cd api and run yarn install again. then run yarn start while still in the api directory. In the other terminal window, navigate to the root directory of the project and run yarn start. Navigate to localhost:5000 in your web browser. This will open the site in a new tab!

## DESCRIPTION ##

This project was coded entirely using ReactJS, a Javascript framework I was previously not familiar with. Here I used the fact that in React the display is constantly a function of the state of the data to design the implimentation for this (in my opinion, very fun!) brain teaser! If you play the game, let me know what you think. 

I enjoyed tackling the challenges presented to me in the design of the game and animation fo the laser. I look forward to working on many more projects using this framework:) 

Huge thanks to my friend Eliot Padzensky who had the patience during college finals sesason to entertain teaching me fundamentals (and more complex characteristics) of ReactJS!
